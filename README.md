# Vikingos Project

This session focuses on the **Vikingos project**, a practical application of Python fundamentals. It is entirely dedicated to practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, functions, and encapsulation. 

Through this project, I solidified my understanding of these concepts by applying my skills in a comprehensive and real-world scenario, improving my problem-solving abilities and coding proficiency.
