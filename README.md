# Vikingos Project

This session focuses on the **Vikingos project**, a practical application of Python fundamentals. It is entirely dedicated to practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, functions, and encapsulation.

Through this project, I solidified my understanding of these concepts by applying my skills in a comprehensive and real-world scenario, improving my problem-solving abilities and coding proficiency.

# Mini Project | Vikingos (Vikings)

## Introduction

The Vikings and Saxons are at war. Both are Soldiers, but they have their own methods of fighting. The Vikings have been transported to Python. YAY!!

In this lab, you will work with the concept of inheritance in Python.

### Getting Started

You will find the following files in the folder for this lab:

- `vikingsClasses.py`
- `1-testSoldier.py`
- `2-testVikings.py`
- `3-testSaxons.py`
- `4-testWar.py`

You are free to use any code editor you have to open these files.

### Challenge Question

Modify the file `vikingsClasses.py` so that all the tests pass.

## Submission

- Modify `vikingsClasses.py` and save your changes.

## Testing

The best way to know how our code is performing is to work with tests. You will test the `vikingsClasses.py` file step by step.

**You will only be editing** the `vikingsClasses.py` file. The files that you will **run** to test your code are: `1-testSoldier.py`, `2-testVikings.py`, `3-testSaxons.py`, and `4-testWar.py`, depending on how far you have progressed in your code.

So, letâ€™s say you have already created the class for Soldiers.

1. Write your code.
2. Make sure to save the changes in your editor.
3. In your terminal, run the test file for that class.

```bash
$ python3 1-testSoldier.py --v
